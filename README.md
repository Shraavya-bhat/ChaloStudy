## File Upload Storage

uploads/<Subject>/<Category>/<file_name>


- Example: uploads/Advanced Java/Notes/Java_OOP.pdf

## Notes

- Make sure uploads/ folder has write permissions.  
- MySQL is optional, only if you want to store metadata about files (uploader, timestamp, etc.).  
- Designed for *5th Semester students*, but easily extendable for other semesters.
